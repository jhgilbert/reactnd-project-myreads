# MyReads Project

This is my take on a homework project for my React nanodegree. The initial commit came from Udacity. All other work is my original code.

## Getting Started

To view the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

The project should open in your browser at `localhost:3000`. Go to town!

## Features to Test

To see this app in action, try the following:

* Move books between shelves on the home page
* Click the + button and search for "Android"
* Add one of the books from that page to a shelf
* Go back to the home page to view the new book on the correct shelf
