# MyReads Project

This is my take on a homework project for my React nanodegree. The initial commit came from Udacity. All other work is my original code.

This app, supported by a Udacity-provided backend API, allows a user to maintain three lists of books: want to read, currently reading, and read. The user can also search for new books and add them to one of the three categories.

## Getting Started

To view the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

The project should open in your browser at `localhost:3000`. Go to town!

## Features to Test

To see this app in action, try the following:

* Move books between shelves on the home page
* Click the + button and search for "Android" (search terms supported by Udacity's API are [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md))
* Add one of the books from that page to a shelf
* Go back to the home page to view the new book on the correct shelf
